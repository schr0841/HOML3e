    "**Warning**: the latest TensorFlow versions are based on Keras 3. For chapters 10-15, it wasn't too hard to update the code to support Keras 3, but unfortunately it's much harder for this chapter, in particular adding custom losses using the functional API is not implemented yet. So for this chapter I've had to revert to Keras 2. To do that, I set the TF_USE_LEGACY_KERAS environment variable to \"1\" and import the tf_keras package. This ensures that tf.keras points to tf_keras, which is Keras 2.*."
