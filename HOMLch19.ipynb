    "**Warning**: the latest TensorFlow versions are based on Keras 3. For chapters 10-15, it wasn't too hard to update the code to support Keras 3, but unfortunately it's much harder for this chapter, so I've had to revert to Keras 2. To do that, I set the ```TF_USE_LEGACY_KERAS ```environment variable to ```\"1\" ```and import the ```tf_keras``` package. This ensures that ```tf.keras``` points to ```tf_keras```, which is Keras 2.*."
